## Install

Install the latest published binary.

**macOS / Linux / Android / Termux:**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RivoLink/leaf/main/scripts/install.sh | sh
```

**Windows:**

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RivoLink/leaf/main/scripts/install.ps1 | iex
```

**npm:**

```bash
npm install -g @rivolink/leaf
```

**ArchLinux (AUR):**

Use an [AUR helper](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/AUR_helpers), such as `yay`:

```bash
yay -S leaf-markdown-viewer
```

**Verify the installation:**

```bash
leaf --version
```

## Update

Update an existing installation to the latest published release.

**Self:**

```bash
leaf --update
```

`leaf --update` downloads the matching published asset, verifies it against the published `checksums.txt` SHA256, and then installs it.

On Windows, if replacing the running `.exe` is blocked by the OS, rerun the PowerShell installer from the install section.

**npm:**

```bash
npm update -g @rivolink/leaf
```

## Development Build

This repository uses [Mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/) to provide a locked Rust toolchain for local development. Install Mise, then run:

```bash
mise install
mise run build
```

To build and replace the locally installed executable in one command:

```bash
mise run install
```

On Windows, `install` replaces `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\leaf\leaf.exe` and automatically loads the MSVC build environment. On macOS (including Apple Silicon), it installs the native build to `~/.local/bin/leaf`; ensure `~/.local/bin` is on your `PATH`.

## Usage

```bash
# Open a Markdown file
leaf TESTING.md

# Watch mode — reloads automatically on save
leaf --watch TESTING.md
leaf -w TESTING.md

# Open the fuzzy Markdown picker
leaf

# Open the classic directory browser picker
leaf --picker

# Open the fuzzy Markdown picker, then watch the selected file
leaf -w

# Open the classic directory browser picker, then watch the selected file
leaf -w --picker

# Open a dash-prefixed filename
leaf -- -notes.md

# Pick a color theme
leaf --theme forest TESTING.md

# Set the external editor
leaf --editor nvim TESTING.md
leaf -e code TESTING.md

# Cap the content width (min: 20)
leaf --width 100 TESTING.md

# Stream Markdown from another CLI tool
claude "explain Rust lifetimes" | leaf

# Preview a local file through stdin
cat TESTING.md | leaf
```

## Inline Mode

Render Markdown directly to **stdout** without the interactive TUI:

```bash
# Render to terminal with colors
leaf --inline README.md

# Force plain text, no ANSI codes (no colors)
leaf --inline plain README.md

# Force ANSI colors even when piping
leaf --inline ansi README.md

# Set a specific width
leaf --inline 60 README.md
leaf --inline ansi:60 README.md

# Pipe from stdin
cat README.md | leaf --inline

# Use as a fzf preview
fzf --preview 'leaf --inline ansi {}'
fzf --preview 'leaf --inline ansi:$FZF_PREVIEW_COLUMNS {}'
```

## Shell Completions

Enable Tab completion for all arguments:

```bash
leaf --auto-complete
```

Supports **bash**, **zsh**, **fish**, and **PowerShell**. Restart your shell to activate.

## Vim Integration
Add the following to your `~/.vimrc` to preview the current Markdown file in a vertical split:

```vim
" Preview the current Markdown file in a vertical split using leaf
nnoremap <Leader>md :vertical botright terminal leaf -w %<CR>
```

Once added, use `\md` to open a live preview. To switch focus back to the Markdown buffer, press `Ctrl+w,h`.

## Configuration

Set default values for **theme**, **editor**, **watch** mode, **extra** file types, and keybindings via `config.toml`:

```bash
leaf --config
```

This opens the configuration file in your editor. If the file does not exist yet, **leaf** creates it with documented defaults.

```toml
theme = "ocean"           # arctic, forest, ocean, solarized-dark, or a custom theme file
editor = "nano"           # any editor in PATH
watch = false             # auto-reload when opening a file
width = 80                # maximum content width (min: 20, default: terminal width)
extras = ["txt", "rs"]    # extra file types shown in the picker
code-line-numbers = true  # show line numbers inside fenced code blocks
tab-title-length = -1     # terminal tab title truncation (min: 20, -1: no truncation)

[keymap.global]
"f12" = "toggle-mouse-capture"

[keymap.viewer]
"esc" = "quit"
"space" = "page-down"
```

To reset the configuration to defaults:

```bash
leaf --config reset
```

All settings are optional. CLI arguments always take priority. See [`config.toml`](config.toml) for details.

## Open in Editor

Press `Ctrl+E` to open the current file in the configured editor.

Use `{$line}` in `editor` to open at the line currently visible in **leaf**:

```toml
editor = 'nano +{$line}'
editor = 'nvim +{$line} +"normal! zz"'
```

For further customization, `{$path}` is also available for the file path:

```toml
editor = 'code -g {$path}:{$line}'
```

Without `{$line}`, the editor opens at the top of the file.

## Extra Files

Non-Markdown files can be listed in the file picker by adding their extensions to `config.toml`:

```toml
extras = ["txt", "csv", "rs", "java", "json", "yaml"]
```

Code files get syntax highlighting; text files are rendered as plain Markdown.

Any file can also be opened directly from the command line, regardless of the `extras` setting:

```bash
leaf main.rs
```

Browse and preview code files with fzf:

```bash
find . -name '*.rs' | fzf --preview 'leaf --inline ansi {}'
```

## Custom Themes

Create a `.toml` file that inherits from a built-in theme and overrides specific colors:

```toml
theme = "/path/to/custom-theme.toml"
```

Relative paths are resolved from the config file directory.

```toml
# custom-theme.toml
base = "ocean"
syntax = "base16-ocean.dark"

[ui]
content_bg = "#282828"
toc_accent = "#fe8019"

[markdown]
text = "#ebdbb2"
heading_1 = "#fabd2f"
```

See [`gruvbox.toml`](gruvbox.toml) for a complete example with all available color keys.

## Keybindings

The help popup and status bar show the effective keybindings. The built-in viewer defaults are:

| Key | Action | Key | Action |
|---|---|---|---|
| `j` / `↓` | Scroll down | `?` | Show help popup |
| `k` / `↑` | Scroll up | `t` | Toggle TOC sidebar |
| `d` / PgDn | Page down (20 lines) | `p` | Show file path |
| `u` / PgUp | Page up (20 lines) | `Shift+L` | Toggle line numbers |
| `g` / Home | Top | `Shift+T` | Open theme picker |
| `G` / End | Bottom | `Shift+E` | Open editor picker |
| `1-9` / `0+1-9` | Jump / reverse jump (TOC) | `Shift+P` | Open file browser |
| `J/K` / `U/D` | Navigate TOC | `Shift+M` | Toggle mouse capture |
| `y/Y` / `c/C` | Focus code block | `Ctrl+P` | Open fuzzy picker |
| `Ctrl+L` | Go to line | `Ctrl+E` | Open in editor |
| `Ctrl+F` / `/` | Find | `Ctrl+Click` | Open link |
| `n` / `N` | Next / prev match | `Double-Click` (link) | Copy link |
| `w` | Toggle watch mode | `Double-Click` (code) | Copy code block |
| `r` | Force reload (watch mode) | `Shift+Drag` | Select text |
| `q` | Quit | `Option+Drag` | Select text (iTerm2) |

Global bindings work across the viewer and most popups. They stay inactive while you type in search, go-to-line, or the fuzzy picker. The built-in global binding is `m` / `M` for toggling mouse capture.

Override only the keys you want to change:

```toml
[keymap.global]
"f12" = "toggle-mouse-capture"
"m" = "none"
"shift+m" = "none"

[keymap.viewer]
"esc" = "quit"
"space" = "page-down"
"backspace" = "page-up"
"q" = "none"
```

Each configured key replaces its built-in binding. Use `"none"` to remove a binding; removing a valid key that is already unbound is harmless. Invalid key names still fail. Every action must keep at least one binding, and a key cannot be assigned in both the global and viewer keymaps.

Modifier matching is exact. `ctrl+j` does not invoke plain `j`, and `alt+q` does not invoke plain `q`. Supported modifiers are `ctrl`, `alt` (`Option` on macOS), and `shift`.

Show the complete effective keymap without opening the TUI:

```bash
leaf --show-keymap-actions global
leaf --show-keymap-actions viewer
leaf --show-keymap-actions viewer --include-hidden-keymap-actions
```

The output lists each key, action, description, and whether that action was affected by `config.toml`. The keymap name is resolved from the registered global and viewer keymaps. See [`config.toml`](config.toml) for more examples.

## Troubleshooting

### Windows: missing Visual C++ runtime

If `leaf.exe` does not start on Windows or reports a missing MSVC runtime, install the latest supported Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable from Microsoft Learn:

- https://learn.microsoft.com/fr-fr/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170

Direct download for the latest supported **X64** Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable:

- https://aka.ms/vc14/vc_redist.x64.exe

For `leaf-windows-x86_64.exe`, the relevant package is the latest supported **X64** Visual C++ v14 Redistributable.

### Windows: update or file replacement error

If `leaf --update` fails on Windows with an error about replacing, renaming, or writing `leaf.exe`, the running executable was likely locked by the OS.

Close any terminal session still running `leaf`, then rerun the PowerShell installer from the install section:

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RivoLink/leaf/main/scripts/install.ps1 | iex
```

### Windows: auto-complete execution policy error

If PowerShell reports that running scripts is disabled on this system after `leaf --auto-complete`, allow local scripts and restart PowerShell:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

## Uninstall

**macOS / Linux / Android / Termux:**

```bash
rm -f ~/.local/bin/leaf
```

**Windows:**

```powershell
Remove-Item "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Programs\leaf\leaf.exe" -Force
```

**npm:**

```bash
npm uninstall -g @rivolink/leaf
```
